# Bun Express App

This project is a TypeScript application that sets up a Bun-compatible Express server. It serves as a basic template for building web applications using Bun and TypeScript.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bun-express-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   bun run start
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`. The default route will respond with a simple message indicating that the server is deployed.

## Project Structure

- `src/index.ts`: Entry point for the application.
- `src/server.ts`: Main server logic and route definitions.
- `src/types/index.ts`: Custom types and interfaces for type safety.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration.
- `bun.lockb`: Dependency lock file for Bun.
